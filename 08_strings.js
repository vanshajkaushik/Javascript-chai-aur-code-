//we can give any variable a string value 

var name = "vanshaj"

console.log(`my name is ${name}`) // this is a way in which we can print a lot of values 

// another way to declare a string is 

const gamename =  new String('vanshaj') //make sure the S in String is capital
console.log(gamename) // here the string is not an array it just stores each value in key value pair format 

// later we can copy this format in the console of our browser and can find different other features (can have reference from the video)

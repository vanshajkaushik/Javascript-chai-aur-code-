//DOM - Document Object Model - here i have written notes only major work was done on the browser console itself review the video for better understanding
// 1) getelementbyid('id')
// we use document.getelementbyid - here document selects the entire page and then we can select the way we want to do DOM 
//queryselector and queryselectorall - first gives only the first value whereas the second gives all the value 
//htmlcollection and nodelist are similar to array but are not actually array to perform the array task we need to convert them to array 
//store the html collection/nodelist in a variable and then 
// Array.from("the variable name ") - this would convert it into array and then we could perform that task 
//myConvertedArray. forEach (function (li){ :foreach is a method usses function as we learnt before 
//li.style.color = 'orange'
//})
//to create an element we use document.createelement("element name")
